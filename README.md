### Getting Started
 
I built this website for a client to help promote their business. I loved having the creative freedom in building this site for Whispering Willow.
                  


<h3>About Whispering Willow's Site</h3>
  <p class="lead">
     This website was made to help promote my clients Venue. They wanted to be able to put all of their packages and venue information in one place for their guests to have easy access to all information. It was important to them that they have a way for their customers to contact them and view FAQs. They also wanted a gallery and testimonials added to their site as well. In the future they wanted the option to add a shop, so I added this to the nav for them for now.
  </p>

  <ul>
      <li>Single Page Website</li>
      <li>Gallery, Video, Carousel, Contact Forms</li>
      <li>Fully Responsive</li>
      <li>Animations</li>
  </ul>

### Hi there, I'm Brittany ðŸ‘‹

### I'm a Developer, Lifelong Student and Content Creator!

- âš¡ Fun Fact: I love to design and play video games!

<h4>About Me</h4>
<p>I am a motivated professional with software development, programming, and UX/UI design experience. Recognized for demonstrating a natural aptitude for developing and delivering exceptional digital experiences, as well as for ensuring optimal code quality and efficiently resolving issues, I have a strong passion for translating and transforming visions and concepts into web-based products. As such, I have consistently exceeded project goals and I am adept at ensuring that solutions are directly aligned with client needs. Professional focal points include software development, UX/UI design, programming, Agile/Waterfall methodology, front-end development, problem solving, object-oriented programming, web development, product evolution, application development, and task prioritization. Delivering superior administration on the latter areas of expertise requires utilization of effective communication skills, critical thinking skills, as well as professional acumen, strategic planning, project management and resource management to support efficiency and maximum returns.
<br><br>
Recently, I graduated from Coder Foundry Bootcamp. During this time, I gained experience with coding, software/front-end development, object-oriented programming, and more. I also improved my knowledge of C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap5, and other tools/languages. Prior to this, I worked as a Sales and Services Agent with RBC Advice Center where I was responsible for developing solutions to meet the financial needs of diverse clients.
 <br><br>
 Colleagues describe me as a progressive, driven, down-to-earth, technical and innovative expert who can be relied on to offer superior solutions that deliver impactful results on time and under budget.
